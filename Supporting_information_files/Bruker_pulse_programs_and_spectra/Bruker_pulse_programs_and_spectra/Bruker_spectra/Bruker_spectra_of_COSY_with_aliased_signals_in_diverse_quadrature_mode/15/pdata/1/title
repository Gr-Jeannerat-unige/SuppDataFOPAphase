Phase calc. to ref. (ph1 - ph2) - NEW PHASE INCREMENTATION (additional phase pulse calculation and sum - Restore quadrature)
Phase ref. to calc. (ph2 - ph4/ph3/ph5) - OLD PHASE INCREMENTATION
- PH31 is incremented using ph30 NEW PHASE INCREMENTATION (additional phase pulse calculation and sum - Restore quadrature)

Pulses that require quadrature incrementation use NEW phase incrementation. Normal pulses just use OLD phase incrementation.
