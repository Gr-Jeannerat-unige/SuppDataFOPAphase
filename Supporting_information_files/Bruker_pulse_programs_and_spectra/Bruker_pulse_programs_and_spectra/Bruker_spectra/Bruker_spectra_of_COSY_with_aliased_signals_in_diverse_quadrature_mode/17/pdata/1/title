Phase calc. to ref. (ph1/ph2 - ph3) - NEW PHASE INCREMENTATION (additional phase pulse calculation and sum - Restore quadrature)
- PH2 is done with OLD PHASE INCREMENTATION
Phase ref. to calc. (ph3 - ph4/ph5/ph6) - OLD PHASE INCREMENTATION
- PH31 is incremented using ph30 NEW PHASE INCREMENTATION (additional phase pulse calculation and sum - Restore quadrature)

Pulses that require quadrature incrementation use NEW phase incrementation. Normal pulses just use OLD phase incrementation.

Phase error in F2 due to different value of VCF - ph31 IS ALSO MODIFIED!!!!! (TRY TO SUPPRESS THE PHASE ERROR)

Still Phase error aroun -60degree (constant???)
