Phase calc. to ref. (ph3 - ph7) - NEW PHASE INCREMENTATION (additional phase pulse calculation and sum - Restore quadrature)
Phase ref. to calc. (ph7 - ph4) - OLD PHASE INCREMENTATION

INEPT and RETRO-INEPT 180-13C are not modified

Pulses that require quadrature incrementation use NEW phase incrementation. Normal pulses just use OLD phase incrementation.

TRIAL USING IP9 FOR A NEW PHASE INCREMENTATION AND THEN USING IT AGAING FOR AN OLD PHASE INCREMENTATION (not cycled for quadrature/incrementation)
